= Adding unauthenticated users to the system:scope-impersonation role binding

As a cluster administrator, you can add unauthenticated users to the `system:scope-impersonation` role binding in {product-title} for specific namespaces. The `system:scope-impersonation` role binding allows users to trigger builds from external systems that do not use an {product-title} authentication mechanism. Unauthenticated users do not have access to non-public role bindings by default. This is a change from {product-title} versions before 4.16.

If it is necessary to allow unauthenticated users access to a cluster, you can do so by adding unauthenticated users to the `system:scope-impersonation` role binding in each required namespace. This method is more secure than adding unauthenticated users to the `system:scope-impersonation` cluster role binding. However, if you have a large number of namespaces, it is possible to add unauthenticated users to the `system:scope-impersonation` cluster role binding which would apply the change to all namespaces.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always verify compliance with your organization's security standards when modifying unauthenticated access.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file named `add-scope-impersonation-unauth.yaml` and add the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  annotations:
    rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
  name: self scope-impersonation-access-unauthenticated
  namespace: <namespace> <1>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: "system:scope-impersonation"
subjects:
  - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: Group
    name: "system:unauthenticated"
----
<1> The namespace of your `BuildConfig`.

. Apply the configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f add-scope-impersonation-unauth.yaml
