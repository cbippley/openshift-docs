= About the {run-once-operator}

{product-title} relies on run-once pods to perform tasks such as deploying a pod or performing a build. Run-once pods are pods that have a `RestartPolicy` of `Never` or `OnFailure`.

The cluster administrator can use the {run-once-operator} to force a limit on the time that those run-once pods can be active. Once the time limit expires, the cluster will try to actively terminate those pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to run for an excessive amount of time.
