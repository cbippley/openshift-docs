The {product-title} cluster administrator can use the {run-once-operator} to force a limit on the time that those run-once pods can be active. Once the time limit expires, the cluster will try to actively terminate those pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to run for an excessive amount of time.

These release notes track the development of the {run-once-operator} in the {product-title}.

For an overview of the {run-once-operator}, see xref:INSERTXREF.adoc#about-run-once-operator[About the {run-once-operator}].

To access the latest release, see xref:INSERTXREF.adoc[Updating the {run-once-operator}].
